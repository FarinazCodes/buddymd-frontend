# BrainStation Capstone Project - BuddyMD - Medication Adherence Tracker (Frontend)

This project is a **React-based frontend** application built with **Vite** as part of a **Capstone Project for BrainStation**. It helps users track their medication adherence by integrating **data visualization, calendar features, and backend communication** to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## üìå Motivation

Medication non-adherence costs the healthcare system between **$100 to $290 billion annually**. More than **40% of the U.S. population** and **over 45% of Canadians** suffer from chronic diseases lasting at least six months or more.

By tracking medication adherence, users can ensure full recovery or determine if further treatment is needed. This project aims to simplify that process using an intuitive, responsive, and feature-rich frontend.
